        <p>"Happy Birthday, Dad! Today, we celebrate not just the years you’ve
            lived, but the countless moments of love, strength, and wisdom you’ve shared with us.
            Your unwavering support and guidance have shaped who I am, and I am forever grateful for every sacrifice
            you've made for our family. On this special day, I want you to know how much you are loved and cherished. 
            May this year bring you as much happiness as you have given to all of us. Cheers to you, Dad, and to many 
            more beautiful memories together!"</p>
